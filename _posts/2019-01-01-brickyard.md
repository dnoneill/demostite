  description: "On the weekend of King's death approximately 200 white students and\
    \ faculty (from UNC and Duke as well as NCSU) gathered in the Brickyard intending\
    \ to march on the State Capitol Building in an attempt to speak with Governor\
    \ Dan Moore. The ultimate goal of the march was to present a petition to the governor\
    \ that showed (as stated in the Technician student newspaper) \"the Negro community\
    \ that concern exists among whites by presenting written grievances to the governor.\"\
    \ However, the march did not go forward as planned. After the Raleigh Police Department\
    \ stopped the group at Winston Hall, Chancellor Caldwell plead with protesters\
    \ to disperse peacefully, saying, \"I wept tears when Martin Luther King died;\
    \ I loved that man. But you don'\xC2\x92t have to demonstrate by breaking the\
    \ law.\" With threats of arrest looming, and National Guard troops waiting farther\
    \ down Hillsborough St. to intercept the march, the protesters dispersed as requested.\
    \ The following Monday, a smaller group went to the Capitol and presented the\
    \ petition to a gubernatorial aide, who promised that the governor would read\
    \ it."
