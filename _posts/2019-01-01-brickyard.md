  description: On the weekend of King's death approximately 200 white students and
    faculty (from UNC and Duke as well as NCSU) gathered in the Brickyard intending
    to march on the State Capitol Building in an attempt to speak with Governor Dan
    Moore. The ultimate goal of the march was to present a petition to the governor
    that "show[ed] the Negro community that concern exists among whites by presenting
    written grievances to the governor." However, the march did not go forward as
    planned. After the Raleigh Police Department stopped the group at Winston Hall,
    Chancellor Caldwell pled with protesters to disperse peacefully, saying, "I wept
    tears when Martin Luther King died; I loved that man. But you don't have to demonstrate
    by breaking the law." With threats of arrest looming, and National Guard troops
    waiting at the Velvet Cloak Inn to intercept the march should it reach that point,
    the protesters dispersed as requested. The following Monday, a smaller group went
    to the Capitol and presented the petition to an aide of the governor, who promised
    that the governor would read it.
