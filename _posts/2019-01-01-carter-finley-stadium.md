  description: Mary Evelyn Porterfield elected first African American Miss NCSU. In
    an interview with the Technician following her selection as homecoming queen,
    Porterfield stated, "If I had been the first black homecoming queen ever at a
    university of this size, I think it would have weighed much more heavily on my
    emotions, but to me, by this time, it seems as ordinary as would have been any
    selection. I think State is three years behind in the trend . . . I realize that
    this is a victory for the blacks on campus, and particularly for the black female."
