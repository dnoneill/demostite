  description: Mary Evelyn Porterfield was elected as the first African American Miss
    NCSU. In an interview with the Technician following her selection as homecoming
    queen, Porterfield stated, "If I had been the first black homecoming queen ever
    at a university of this size, I think it would have weighed much more heavily
    on my emotions, but to me, by this time, it seems as ordinary as would have been
    any selection. I think State is three years behind in the trend . . . I realize
    that this is a victory for the blacks on campus, and particularly for the black
    female."
