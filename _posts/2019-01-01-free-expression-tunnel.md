  description: Racist and threatening graffiti, directed at (then) President-elect
    Barack Obama, was found in the Free Expression Tunnel. Because of the threats,
    the Secret Service was among those called to investigate. The four students responsible
    were identified and admitted to the act. The students issued an anonymous public
    apology. In response to the incident, which received international media attention,
    Chancellor Oblinger established the Campus Culture Task Force Committee to discuss
    methods of improving the campus climate and possible revisions for Student Conduct
    practices and Free Expression Tunnel procedures. Students also held a "Unity Rally"
    to denounce the acts of racism.
