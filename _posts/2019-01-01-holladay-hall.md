  description: The year 1988 marked the first time that the university recognized
    Martin Luther King Day. University administrators initially announced the substitution
    of Easter Monday for MLK day, however students reacted negatively to this suggestion.
    Student Body President Kevin Howell introduced an open forum to hear student concerns
    about the spring calendar changes. Upon hearing support for both holidays, Howell
    pushed the administration to observe both Easter and MLK day. University leaders
    compromised by canceling classes on MLK Day and Good Friday and by holding classes
    on a Saturday.
