  description: In 1953, NC State College hosted a dairy farm conference on campus.
    Chancellor Bostian declared that African American dairy farmers attending the
    conference could only eat in the west wing of the dining hall. Bostian's announcement
    was in keeping with the College's policy, which declared African Americans attending
    on campus meetings would have meals in the dining hall but only when a separate
    room was available. Leazar Hall served as the campus-dining hall until 1971.
