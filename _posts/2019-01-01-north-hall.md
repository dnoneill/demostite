  description: Student Body President Brian Nixon was attacked near his dorm room
    in North Hall. Prior to this attack, public safety provided Nixon with security.
    Nixon received racial death threats and intimidating calls and letters throughout
    his presidency. As student body president, Nixon implemented programs that encouraged
    students to practice ethical behavior and allowed students to meet with campus
    leaders in informal settings. Nixon accomplished many successful programs in spite
    of the personal racial threats he received while president. The violence escalated
    in February 1990 when Nixon was attacked in the early morning while walking to
    his residence hall. Nixon resigned as president in March 1990, one month prior
    to the end of his term. He cited personal reasons for his resignation and stated,
    "The pain and pressure has finally taken its toll physically, mentally, emotionally,
    and especially academically."
