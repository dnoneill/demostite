  description: 'The building formerly known as the Student Center Annex was dedicated
    on this date to honor Dr. Augustus McIver Witherspoon. It thus became the first
    building on campus named after an African American. Dr. Witherspoon earned his
    Ph.D. in Botany from NCSU in 1971, making him the second African American student
    to receive a Ph.D. from NC State. He joined the faculty as Instructor of Botany
    and eventually held the following posts at NCSU: Full Professor, Assistant Dean,
    Acting Dean and Associate Dean of the Graduate School, Associate Provost and Coordinator
    of African American Affairs.'

  description: The Nubian Message began publication in response to student protests
    alleging racial bias by the Technician. Tony Williamson served as the new paper's
    first editor-in-chief. In the inaugural issue, Williamson stated his intention
    to "totally, truthfully, and faithfully" cover every aspect of African American
    life at NCSU" and his hope that The Nubian Message become "the media voice for
    African Americans at NC State" a publication where people can learn about different
    aspects of your culture, as well as find useful information about State's campus."
    Because The Nubian Message received no university funding and Nubian staff was
    prohibited from using NCSU media equipment, the first issue was published with
    help from North Carolina Central University. Recalling the paper's initial struggles
    Williamson stated, "It was a real pain to have to go all the way to Durham to
    work, but the people at Central were very helpful and understanding. We owe them
    a lot. If it wasn't for their newspaper staff, we probably would never have had
    a first issue." Following publication of the first issue, the university allowed
    the Nubian staff to utilize campus media equipment.
