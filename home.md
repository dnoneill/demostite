Initially conceived as a human-guided walking tour about African-American history at NC State, and extended into a mobile tour available via this site. The Red, White &amp; Black (RWB) project is an innovative approach to engagement that fosters the use of library resources, enhances educational goals, and provides opportunities for innovative partnerships. It is a collaboration between the NCSU Libraries, the <a href="https://oied.ncsu.edu/aacc/">African American Cultural Center</a>, and the <a href="https://history.ncsu.edu/">Department of History</a> at NC State. RWB gives participants the chance to explore spaces on campus that have had significant impact on the lives of African-American students, faculty, alumni, and administrators.
